# Polls demo app

This is an example from official Django documentation. I saved it here just to have some code examples on hand.

Working app is "poll". Directory "polls [non-generic]" contains files that we replaced when don't using Django's Generic views. You may read [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial04/#use-generic-views-less-code-is-better) about it.
